# Project Introduction

In recent years, there have been high profile cases of public sector procurement fraud and corruption in Singapore. Singapore public sector procurement is mainly done via GeBIZ, an e-procurement portal where public agencies publish invitations for quotations and tenders. For public sector procurement, there is a need to identify areas where there is possible over-reliance on a particular supplier. Such over-reliance could point to risks or possible irregularities that would need to be investigated.

Currently GeBiz has two separate procurement analytics tools, namely GeBIZ InSIGHT and GeBIZ Management Console (GMC). GeBiz InSIGHT aims at allowing procurement officers to gain insights into the potential procurement opportunities. GeBIZ Management Console (GMC) aims at providing decision makers with visibility of public procurement. Although these tools allow insight gathering for decision making, they are aimed at public sector level. An improvement on this would be making it transparent to the suppliers as well, enabling them to gain insights on potential market opportunities. A single platform consisting of analytics targeted at both supplier and public agencies would also improve the procurement efficiency.
