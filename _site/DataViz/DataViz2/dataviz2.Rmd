# 1. Original Visualization

![](img/original.png)

The data visualisation above is created by the following 2 datasets:

* *origin_destination_bus_SZ_202201.csv*, this data set was downloaded from LTA Datamall and URA region, planning area and planning subzone information were added by using GIS Overlay operation.

* *MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL*, this data provides URA Master Plan 2014 Planning Subzone boundary map in ESRI shapefile format. It was downloaded from data.gov.sg.

# 2. Critique of original visualization 

## 2.1 Clarity 

* The visualization lacks dashboard title and a brief description of what this dashboard is about, users have difficulty understanding the context and purpose of this visualization thus may undermine the effectiveness of messages conveyed. For example, it is not clear what is the trips referring to unless the user looks at the data set to know that it is bus flows. Moreover, the chart titles are unclear to the user, for example "Weekday ajacency Matrix" is a term that is not friendly to users without statistical background and hence one may ignore this part.

* The axis labels are unclear to the user. For example, in the bar charts, there is no unit for the values, users cannot tell what does the y-axis numbers trying to show, more clarity should be added to show it is the "number of trips". Moreover, the x axis "Time Per Hour" may be potentially misleading as some users may misunderstand it as how many times per hour the values are related to the trips instead of the time, i.e. from 1am to 12am. The label can be better phrased to be commonly understandable. 

* The abbreviations used for the charts and labels are inappropriate. For the adjacency matrix axis and the legend labels, "Destination Sz" and "Origin Sz" are used, it is impossible for the user to know what does "Sz" referring to. For uncommon abbreviations, it is more recommended to use full term. 

* The adjacency matrix is compressed in size with rows and column names overlapping with each other and there is no column names shown for the weekend chart under "Origin Sz". With existing adjacency matrix, users have difficulty locating each point on the chart for further exploration. It does not provide useful information by simply looking at the chart either. 

* the y-axis column name for the charts is not fully shown, only "Weekends" was visible instead of "Weekends/holiday". This may lead users to mistaken the values for only weekends. 

* The data cleaning was not completely done as there are null values for both destination and origin subzones. 

## 2.2 Aesthetics

* The size of adjacency matrix is too small to be readable. Despite the chart being interactive, it is hard for the user to hover to the desired point for further analysis. Moreover, the patterns of the matrix is impaired by the small figure size and hence cannot tell if there is a color difference used for visualization purpose. The users are unable to use the aesthetics of the matrix to understand the distribution and intensity of the bus flows between subzones. 

* The dashboard space is not fully utilized. There are 4 bar charts separating weekend and weekdays by different subzones where they could be potentially reduced to 1 per subzone. The adjacency matrix on the other hand could be rearranged to be significantly larger. 

* Separate charts were used to display weekday and weekend bus distributions, making it difficulty for users to see the comparison between the day types. In fact, weekday and weekend distributions can be combined into a single chart so that users do not have to hover and compare especially there are more than 10 columns for "Time Per Hour", it will easily lead to interpretation error. 

* The y-axis values for bar charts are not synchronized across, for example on the Origin subzone the units are in millions but on Destination subzone the units are in thousands. This will undermine the accuracy for the users to make comparisons. 

## 2.3 Interactivity

* Filters are not linked to each other hence not maximizing the interactivity provided by dashboard actions. Current filters are rigid in a way that origin and destination subzones are filtered separately. It does not reflect in depth information, for example where are the destinations of the origin bus trips. Users have to manually select them. 

* Tool tips were included but it only shows information that can be interpreted on the charts themselves, additional information could be embedded so that users can hover over a mark to examine the details-on-demand. 

* When selecting a highlight on the chart, there is no interactivity among the charts, highlighting function is not fully utilized. 

# 3. Proposed design 

## 3.1 Design sketch 

![](img/sketch.png)

## 3.2 Advantages of proposed design 

* A distribution map was embedded into the dashboard as one of the main visualization. It provides a intra-zonal analytics for bus flows in singapore. Users are able to select the orgin subzone from the map, and it will show all the corresponding destination subzones related, Moreover, the color intensity of different destination subzones will give the user an overview of the subzones with most bus trips and least bus trips. 

* Line charts are linked with distribution map. For example, when user selects origin subzone in the map, "Bus trips from Admiralty" chart will show the total distribution from Admiralty. Subsequently when the user dive into the different corresponding destination subzones, for instance Changi Airport, the "Bus trips to Changi airport" line chart will show the distribution of bus frequencies from Admiralty to Changi Airport. 

* The line charts shows the average number of trips for both weekday and weekend/holiday. This allows users to know at which time slots are the peak hours related to a subzone. 

* Line charts combines weekday and weekend/holiday bus flows into a single chart, allowing better comparisons 

* The adjacency matrix allows selection on regions on top of the subzones, providing users an option to either analyze at a overall level, or drill down to region and subzone levels. This allows inter-zonal analysis based on regions. Color intensity was improved. 

* Destination and origin subzone labels are included in the tool tips of adjacency matrix instead of showing them on the axis that will cause overlaps in display. Tool tips includes details on destination region and subzone, origin region and subzone, total number of trips, as well as frequency bar charts of both destination and orgin by day type, allowing users to have in-depth analysis on a selected mark. 

* Filters are changed to dropdown selections, allowing more space for visualization. 

* Instructions of interactivity are included besides the chart titles

# 5. Conclusion and insights 

## 5.1 Final data visualization 

The final data visualization is shown below, it is also available at [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/xiaoqi.min/viz/DataViz2_16482587836840/Dashboard1)

![](img/final.png)

## 5.2 Insights 

* From Inter-zonal bus flow distribution chart (adjacency matrix), inter-zonal bus trips are more densely populated within the same region.

![](img/f2.png)

There are significantly fewer bus trips from a subzone travelling to other subzones in another region. There are more inter-zonal interactions between bus trips from central region and North East region to the rest of the regions, but bus trips in other regions mainly interact within its own region. 

![](img/f1.png)

* From the distribution map, darker colored subzones with high number of total bus trips, for example Tampines, Bedok, Aljunid, Toa Payoh Central, Bishan East, Serangoon Central, Woodland East and Jurong West Central, are locations near bus interchanges as seen from [Figure 1](https://busrouter.sg/). Bus interchanges will have higher frequencies of bus flows than subzones with mainly neighborhood. 

* On the other hand, the darker colored subzones with high number of total bus trips are those areas with very few MRT stations around them, as seen from the red boxes in [Figure 3](https://mrt.sg/map), whereas in the blue box which is the CBD area with multiple MRT stations and lines, the bus trip distribution is not as intense. Bus becomes a more accessble vehicle when it comes to remote areas that MRT is not less available. 

![](img/f3.png)

* For intra-zonal bus flows, the peak hours during weekdays are from 6-8am and 5-6pm, while bus flows during weekends and holidays are more evenly distributed across a day. Weekday peak hours are attributed to working and school hours. From the line charts, each subzone still have more time slots that have above average bus flows, hence there is a need to implement more measures to ease the peak hours.
